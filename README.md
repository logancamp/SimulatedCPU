# SimulatedCPU
This project contains a simulated version of a CPU that can run basic binary instructions. There are some default binary instructions. These instructions include: <br><br>

add $8, $6, $7<br>
or $9, $8, $7<br>
add $10, $9, $9<br>
and $11, $9, $10<br>
slt $2, $3, $10

<br><br>

The program will pop up a gui when run, you must run the tester file not the CPU file, but both files are needed for the program to work. The program will output results in both the GUI but also print to terminal.
